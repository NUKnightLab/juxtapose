## Overview

Files in the inner `juxtapose` directory are resources for deployment to the CDN.

Files in the `website` directory are specific to the website.

`config.json` is used to control building, staging, and deployment


## Deploying to the CDN

To stage your changes to a versioned directory in your local CDN repository, type `fab stage` This runs a build, copies the files into a versioned directory in your local `cdn.knightlab.com` repository, and tags the last commit with a version number.

To stage your changes to the `latest` directory in your local CDN repository, type `fab stage_latest` This copies files from a versioned directory in your local `cdn.knightlab.com` respository into the corresponding `latest` directory. 

You must push and deploy all CDN changes separately from that repository.


## Deploying to S3 (timeline.knightlab.com)

To deploy to S3, type `fab stg deploy` or `fab prd deploy` depending on whether you want to deploy it to the production or testing server.
